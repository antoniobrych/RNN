# RNN from Scratch with Numpy 

Welcome to the repository for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implementation from scratch! This project was developed with the goal of deeply understanding RNN algorithms and comparing a custom implementation with TensorFlow's version.

## Overview

This RNN implementation is built using only `numpy` and mathematics, such as multivariable calculus and linear algebra. The project includes constructing a basic RNN, training it on a synthetic dataset, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Deep Understanding of RNN Algorithm**: By manually implementing the RNN, we aim to gain an in-depth understanding of its internal mechanisms.
- **Comparison with TensorFlow**: To evaluate how our custom implementation performs compared to TensorFlow's RNN implementation.

## Features

- **Custom RNN Implementation**: Build an RNN from scratch using `numpy`.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the RNN on a synthetic dataset and assess its performance.
- **Comparison Scripts**: Compare results with TensorFlow's RNN to analyze differences in performance and behavior.
